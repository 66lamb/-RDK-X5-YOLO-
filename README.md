# -RDK-X5-YOLO-
"Falling Shadow Catcher" - Landslide Detection System Based on RDK X5 and YOLO Model

This is a low-cost, high-reliability intelligent monitoring system designed for geological disaster prevention on mountainous highway and railway slopes. By combining sandbox simulation with embedded AI and visual recognition technologies, the system enables automatic route tracking, real-time rockfall detection, and remote early warning, providing practical technical solutions for grassroots disaster prevention. It can be applied to the "Micro Geological Disaster Simulation Monitoring and Warning System".
